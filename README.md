# UNP_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_STUDENT_SALARY

Description: A Student Salary Project using Python is a simple application that helps manage and calculate students' monthly earnings or allowances.
            It typically involves creating a program that tracks income sources, such as part-time jobs or internships, and calculates totals based on user input.
             Python is used to automate tasks like data entry, salary calculations, and generating reports. 
             It may also include features like input validation, data storage (e.g., using lists or databases), and basic financial analysis. 
              This project helps students practice Python fundamentals like functions, loops, conditionals, and file handling.
